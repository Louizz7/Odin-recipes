    <h1><strong>yogurt_parfait recipe</strong></h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am not that fond of yogurts in general but the yogurt parfait is something I welcome as breakfast or dessert. This yogurt recipe idea catches my fancy because it incorporates ingredients that I love: fruits and nuts.

        It’s also very easy to make and is a quick and interesting breakfast option. You will love the contrasting textures of yogurt and cereal soaked in the sweet fruit juices.I hope you enjoy and welcome it as a breakfast option as I have.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of plain non fat yoghurt (you can use flavored yogurt)</li>
        <li>1 cup of cereal or granola or muesli or mixed nuts (Kellogs brand preferred)</li>
        <li>1 cup of fresh or frozen fruits, peeled and sliced (you can use any combination of fruits that you want,for this recipe, I used pawpaw,and grapes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of honey (you don’t need the honey if you use sweetened yoghurt)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs like scent leaf, basil, mint etc. for garnishing, optional</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the honey to the plain yoghurt and mix well.</li>
        <li>In a clean tall glass cup, layer 1/2 cup of yoghurt at the bottom and allow to settle.</li>
        <li>Then place 1/4 cup fruits followed by 1/4 cup granola etc.</li>
        <li>Alternate the layers of fruits and  granola/cereal etc with yoghurt until the glass is filled.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh herb leaves. Repeat the process for the second glass cup.</li>
        <li>Serve parfaits immediately to keep granola or cereal crunchy.</li>
    </ol>
